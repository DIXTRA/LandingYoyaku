                        Individual Rewards:
                      Each person who achieves the monthly individual goal earns a gift card from Amazon, Chipotle, or other supported vendor. You set the budget and choose the prize, we do the rest. More fair, more effective, and far easier to implement than a conventional gym reimbursement program.

Count It makes this one-click easy â€” we connect to every U.S. non-profit. Give a little, and watch the world pay your group back in the form of higher productivity, lower absenteeism, and more committed people.
