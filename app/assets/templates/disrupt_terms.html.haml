      ### Count It Terms of Service and Privacy Policy ("CIL End User Terms") 


      Thanks for using Count It! These terms of service ("Terms") cover your use and access to the Count It web platform, related mobile apps, and support services (“Services”) provided by Count It Labs, Inc. along with our Private Label Partners (“PL Partners”).  On Count It, you will participate in challenges and wellness program run by your company, organization, or other community group (“Group”). By using our Services, you're agreeing to be bound by these Terms, and you're agreeing to these Terms on behalf of your Group.


      ### Your Data

      End Users: While using Count It, you may connect one or more health and fitness tracking apps or devices, and participate in challenges and wellness programs with your Count It Group. You will at all times have access to the all of the data that you share on the system, including your account settings and contact data, and you may remove your account at any time, and delete all of your data.
       
      Group Admins: Some End Users will also have administrative responsibility for their Count It Groups (“Group Admins”). Group Admins, including those of paying subscribers to our Count It PRO service, and clients of our PL Partners, have access to our various Admin tools. These tools allow Admins to delete user accounts, or to bar End Users from their Group. Group Admins can also access and download various data sets pertaining to their Group, including aggregate user activity data, challenge results, rewards payouts, and daily per user Count It Score data. Group Admins use this data to operate their wellness program, and agree not to share this data with any additional third parties without your express consent, unless required to do so by law.
      
      Count It and its PL Partners will not share your personal or any Group data with any third parties unless required to do so by law, or with your express consent. Count It retains the right to use the information in the normal course of new product development to improve the system, fix bugs, and otherwise run our service.

      You're responsible for your conduct. If you misbehave on our system your account will be deleted. With that said, we have no obligation to do so. We aren't responsible for the content people post and share via the Services.
      
      Please safeguard your password to the Services, make sure that others don't have access to it, and keep your account information current.
      
      Finally, our Services are not intended for and may not be used by people under the age of 13. By using our Services, you are representing to us that you're over 13.

      ### Termination

      You're free to stop using our Services at any time. We also reserve the right to suspend or end the Services at any time at our discretion and without notice.

      ### Services "AS IS"

      We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can't guarantee. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, COUNT IT AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some states don't allow the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.

      ### Limitation of Liability

      TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT COUNT IT HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; (B) AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES MORE THAN THE GREATER OF $20 OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO COUNT IT FOR THE PAST 12 MONTHS OF THE SERVICES IN QUESTION. Some states don't allow the types of limitations in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.

      ### Resolving Disputes

      *Let's Try To Sort Things Out First.* We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Count It, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting support@countit.com. We'll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or Count It may bring a formal proceeding.
      
      *No Class Actions.* You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren't allowed.

      ### Controlling Law & Venue

      These Terms will be governed by Delaware law except for its conflicts of laws principles. Any dispute under this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the state and federal courts within the State of Delaware.

      ### Entire Agreement

      These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Count It with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.

      ### Waiver, Severability &amp; Assignment

      Count It's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. Count It may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.

      ### Modifications

      We may revise these terms from time to time, and will always post the most current, operative version on our website - and notify all Count It PRO clients of any changes from version to version. If a revision materially affects a client's rights, we will email the proposed changes to all Count It PRO clients 30 days in advance of posting to the site to allow review and comment.
